# SubbandAdapt
### Subband Adaptive Systems with Crossterms for aliasing cancellation

These scripts and functions was developed for a project of the course *Circuiti e Algoritmi per Applicazioni Mutimediali* at Università Politecnica delle Marche

* `N_LMS.m` simple LMS and NLMS single channel adaptive filter

* `QMF_2.m` Quadrature Mirror Filter bank for analysis/synthesis, made with Johnston 12B coefficients

* `QMF_poly.m` Quadrature Mirror Filter bank for analysis/synthesis, made with Johnston 12B coefficients and polyphase decomposition

* `pQMF.m` Multi-band pseudo QMF filter bank for analysis/synthesis, made with cosine modulation of a prototype LP filter

* `Adaptive_QMFB_2.m` Adaptive 2-band structure with QMF

* `Adaptive_QMFB_2_cross.m` Adaptive 2-band structure with QMF and cross-filters

* `Adaptive_pQMFB.m` Adaptive multiband structure with pseudoQMF and cross-filters

* `pqmfa.m` , `pqmfs.m` analysis/synthesys functions

* `nlms_cross_dual.m` , `nlms_cross_multi.m` adaptive functions
